# Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow
# - Processing our own Data p.48 - Part 5
We are using the following version of TensorFlow

```py
python -c "import tensorflow; print('Tensorflow library version is =',tensorflow.__version__)"
```
which is:

```py
Tensorflow library version is = 1.13.1
```

## Output of current file
To run this file use

```
python ~/3_PracticalMachineLearning/Projectfiles/P48_XXX.py
```
## - My Note
We will work with both negative and positive sentiment data set. We will come up with a dictionary for words we know and convert to a vector form to get the results.

## NOTE
We will need a package called **nltk** short for **Natural Language tool-Kit** and after you get to install the tool first using

```py
pip install nltk
```
Later you can go the next step, which is to show the following, in the terminal specifically.

```py
import nltk
nltk.download()
then pick the option -all
```
Here is how you install them all together see

Then you will get the results as,

## Hint
Read more about Natural language processing in our different project file that we worked on. Starting with stemming then lemmatizing.
