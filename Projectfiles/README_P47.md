# Deep Learning with Neural Networks and TensorFlow
## - Running our Network p.47
We are using the following version of TensorFlow

```py
python -c "import tensorflow; print('Tensorflow library version is =',tensorflow.__version__)"
```
which is:

```py
Tensorflow library version is = 1.13.1
```

## Output of current file
To run this file use

```
python ~/3_PracticalMachineLearning/Projectfiles/P47_XXX.py
```
## - My Note
We will continue form P.46 and here we go.
