# Mean Shift Dynamic Bandwidth - Practical Machine
## Learning Tutorial with Python p.42

We're going to continue working on our custom Mean Shift algorithm from scratch.

## Output of current file
To run this file use

```
python ~/3_PracticalMachineLearning/Projectfiles/P42_MeanShiftDynamicBandwidth.py
```

## - My Note
We will add a **weight** to the algorithm to avoid changing the radius after a specific value.
